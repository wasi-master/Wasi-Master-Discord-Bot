Call me [[Name]]. Some [[length of time, plural]] ago—never mind how long precisely—having little or no [[plural noun]] in my purse, and nothing particular to interest me on shore, I thought I would sail about a little and see the [[adjective]] part of the [[noun]]. It is a way I have of [[verb ending in -ing]] off the spleen and [[verb ending in -ing]] the [[noun]].  ... Whenever it is a damp, [[adjective]] [[Month]] in my soul; ... I [[adverb ending in -ly]] take to the ship. There is nothing surprising in this. If [[pronoun]] but knew it, almost all men in their degree, some time or other, [[verb]] very nearly the same [[plural noun]] towards the ocean with me.

-Herman Melville
