Today, my camp group went to a(n) [[adjective]] amusement park. It was a fun park with lots of cool [[plural noun]]. When we got there, my [[adjective]] counselor shouted loudly, "Everybody off the [[noun]]." We all pushed out in a terrible hurry. My counselor handed out [[adjective]] [[plural noun]], and we scurried in. I was so excited! I couldn't figure out what exciting thing to do first. I saw a scary roller coaster I really liked so, I [[adverb]] ran over to get in the long line that had about [[number]] people in it. When I finally got on the roller coaster I was [[past tense verb]]. In fact I was so nervous my knees were knocking together. This was the [[-est adjective]] ride I had ever been on! In about two minutes I heard the crank and grinding of the gears. That's when the ride began! When I got to the bottom, I was a little [[past tense verb]] but I was proud of myself. The rest of the day went [[adverb]]. It was a(n) [[adjective]] day at the fun park.
